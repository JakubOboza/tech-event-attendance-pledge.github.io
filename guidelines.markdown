title: Tech Event Attendance Pledge
---

This site is readily open to pull requests and change. These lists should
be considered stopgap measures as we as a community develop functional and
comprehensive accountability processes that make such measures unnecessary.

The names of supporters may be changed or modified at any time based on the feelings of
the signatories and changes in the situation. When a list becomes unnecessary
because a better process is in place, it will be removed.

New lists may be warranted from time to time, such as when a person in the 
community:

  * has done or threatened something extreme that constitutes a sexual, 
  violent, or other form of assault;
  * shows a repeated history of violating codes  of conduct or anti-harrasment policies;
  * violates the person of another (e.g. unwanted touching, intimate photographs
  without permission, or physical  threats); 
  * and the incident(s) in question are verifiable (corroborated by others
  present, conference organizers, or legal authorities).

In such cases we feel that it is our responsiblity to provide a means for members of our community to  express their intention to avoid events that will be attended by the persons in question out of concern for their safety, the safety of their peers, and the overall betterment of the community.

This list is only to be used as a method of last resort for extreme cases. New lists will not be created for other issues such as personal disagreements, minor annoyances, or individual violations of codes of conduct that do not justify being banned from a conference.
