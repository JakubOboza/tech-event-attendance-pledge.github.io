The following people have pledged not to attend any tech events without a
clear code of conduct and/or anti-harassment policy:

## Resources
* [Detailed recommendations and sample policies from the Geek Feminism Wiki](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment)
* Policies need to be clear, visible and actionable to be useful. All attendees at
  a given event should be aware of the policy and be able to easily reference it.
* Policies need to be enforced. This means that event staff should be trained on
  the policy, have a plan for handling incidents, and be willing to enforce the
  policy if incidents occur.
