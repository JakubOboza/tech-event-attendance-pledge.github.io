**Note:** We encourage conferences to add a code of conduct or
anti-harassment policy. Non-attendance is a method of last resort if organizers
are unwilling to do so. There are resources on this page to help you
get started. Please reach out if you need help creating a policy. There are many
people who will volunteer to assist you.

## Resources
* [Detailed recommendations from the Geek Feminism Wiki](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment)
* Policies need to be clear, visible and actionable to be useful. All attendees at
  a given event should be aware of the policy and be able to easily reference it.
* Policies need to be enforced. This means that event staff should be trained on
  the policy, have a plan for handling incidents, and be willing to enforce the
  policy if incidents occur.
