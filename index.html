title: Tech Event Attendance Pledge
---

<div id="home">
  <p>This site is a barebones basic way to track people pledging not to attend events
    where a specific person is present. Please file
    <a href="https://github.com/tech-event-attendance-pledge/tech-event-attendance-pledge.github.io">pull requests</a> or <a href="https://github.com/tech-event-attendance-pledge/tech-event-attendance-pledge.github.io/issues">issues</a> to add your voice.</p>

  <p>This site exists to collect information about people who wish to avoid
    attending events where a specific person is in attendance. It makes no
    claims about the intent of the people signing the list beyond
    their wish to publicly state they will avoid that person. The list also
    does not make any claims about the reasons for why a person
    should be avoided. It may link to reference materials from others, when
    relevant.</p>

  <p>One of the hopes for creating this site is that it will be a useful
    resource for event organizers when they are organizing their events.</p>
