title: Tech Event Attendance Pledge
---

<div id="home">
  <p>This site is a barebones basic way to track people pledging not to attend
    events for specific reasons that are important to them. Please file
    <a href="https://github.com/tech-event-attendance-pledge/tech-event-attendance-pledge.github.io">pull requests</a> or <a href="https://github.com/tech-event-attendance-pledge/tech-event-attendance-pledge.github.io/issues">issues</a> to add your voice.</p>

  <p>This site may provide information about people who wish to avoid
    attending events where a specific person is in attendance. It makes no
    claims about the intent of the people signing the list beyond
    their wish to publicly state they will avoid that person. The list also
    does not make any claims about the reasons for why a person
    should be avoided. It may link to reference materials from others, when
    relevant.</p>

  <p>One of the hopes for creating this site is that it will be a useful
    resource for event organizers when they are organizing their events.</p>

  <p>This site is not intended to address all issues that may be directly or
    tangentially related to these pledges. It is attempting to make sure that
    our events continue to be safe spaces. This is one small part of what
    should be larger processes.</p>

  <p>This site is readily open to pull requests and change. These lists should
    not be seen as set in stone, but a work in progress as part of what
    should be larger accountability processes.</p>
