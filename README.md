Tech Event Attendance Pledge
======================================

# About This Project

[This site](http://tech-event-attendance-pledge.github.io/) gives voice to people with concerns about attending events that they do not consider safe because of the attendance of specific and serious offenders or
serial violators of conference codes of conduct.

The project is readily open to pull requests and change. The lists published via this project are stopgap measures as we as a community develop functional and comprehensive accountability processes that make such measures unnecessary.

The names of supporters may be changed or modified at any time based on the
feelings of the signatories and changes in the situation. When a list becomes
unnecessary because a better process is in place, it will be removed.

Individual pledges can be found in the [_posts](https://github.com/tech-event-attendance-pledge/tech-event-attendance-pledge.github.io/tree/master/_posts) folder organized by the date of
creation and the user's identifier.

# Pull Requests

# Guidelines for New Lists

New lists may be warranted from time to time, such as when a person in the
community:

  * has done or threatened something extreme that constitutes a sexual,
  violent, or other form of assault;
  * shows a repeated history of violating codes  of conduct or anti-harrasment policies;
  * violates the person of another (e.g. unwanted touching, intimate photographs
  without permission, or physical  threats);
  * and the incident(s) in question are verifiable (corroborated by others
  present, conference organizers, or legal authorities).

In such cases we feel that it is our responsiblity to provide a means for members of our community to  express their intention to avoid events that will be attended by the persons in question out of concern for their safety, the safety of their peers, and the overall betterment of the community.

This list is only to be used as a method of last resort for extreme cases. New lists will not be created for other issues such as personal disagreements, minor annoyances, or individual violations of codes of conduct that do not justify being banned from a conference.
